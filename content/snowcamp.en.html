              <h2>What is SnowCamp?</h2>
              <p>First and foremost, it's a high-level technical conference that focuses on innovation.
                SnowCamp brings IT professionals and researchers together to discuss today's and tomorrow’s technologies.
              </p>
              <p>SnowCamp is a unique concept: day-long workshops on Wednesday,
                to learn or improve a certain technology;
                a more classical conference on Thursday and Friday, and a socializing and relaxing day on the snow,
                in the mountains, on Saturday.</p>

              <h2>Grenoble and the innovation</h2>
              <p>Since the early stage of electricity, Grenoble has been a place
                 of innovation: laboratories and industries at the forefront of
                 technology have established themselves there. It was ranked #5
                 most innovative city in the world by Forbes magazine and it is
                 now labelled "French Tech" as a recognition of its technical
                 leadership in France. In Grenoble, innovation dugs its roots in
                 the surrounding mountains. That’s why the SnowCamp team organizes
                 an "unconference" day following the conference where attendees
                 will keep on sharing their knowledge and ideas in a less formal
                 and more relax context, prone to creativity: the snowy slopes.</p>

              <h2>Conferences</h2>
              <p>SnwoCamp is built around three main events:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the Universities, on Wednesday, offer the opportunity to discover
                     a technology in depth and hands-on, through workshops that
                     last half a day or the whole day,
                </li>
                <li>the Conference, on Thursday and Friday, offers a more classical model:
                  45 minutes presentations. In 2017, the conference was structured
                  around 4 tracks: Discovery, Web &amp; Cloud, Security, IoT,
                </li>
                <li>the Unconference, on Saturday, offers to speakers and attendees
                  an opportunity to meet each others on the slopes of the Grenoble area.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The first edition back in 2016 gathered ~200 attendees and speakers in Minatec
                research facility, and grow with your support to be hosted in Grenoble's
                World Trade Center to gather ~450 attendees and ~70 speakers in 2022.</p>

              <h2>The unconference</h2>
              <p>A conference is more than just attending presentations, it's
                 also the discussions with the other participants, meeting the speakers...
                 What better to continue these exchanges other than a day in the open air?
                 SnowCamp ends with a day on the skiing slopes, in order to take advantage
                 of the exceptional surroundings of Grenoble.</p>
